            People, especially Gen Z this year are using one color style to show
            themselves. They're loving brown and beige shades plus green like a
            forest for their look in 2021. From sports clothes to work wear,
            it's more than just color. We need textures, putting things on top
            of each other and decorating ourselves for a special look. Beyond
            clothes, this style has also affected makeup with natural colors and
            hair with dark warm hues. Its all-welcome nature lets everyone
            change how they dress and show their own style.

            views on TikTok shows they are getting popular again with young
            people as fall comes nearer. People shopping for fashion basics look
            for styles that are straight and end near their ankles. Using simple
            clothes like turtlenecks and brown pointy boots has become popular.
            This shows that old-fashioned style can be mixed with modern fashion
            styles today.

            appeal of baggy jeans. Young fashion leaders easily mix these jeans
            with other fall favorites. They wear ballet flats or off-the
            shoulder tops to make a relaxed, but stylish outfit. On the other
            hand, some people choose a completely baggy style. They try out big
            pants with wide legs and huge blazers to show off a trendy look of

            Like the big impact of '90s fashion, thick shoe bottoms are coming
            back strong. Before, flat shoes were the go-to choice. But nowadays,
            platforms and raised heels are preferred instead. More and more
            people are starting to like shoe styles that look old-fashioned,
            similar to how Prada or Gucci shoes used to be. Especially in
            countries famous for their fashion, these looks have become so liked
            that people are comparing them to the well-known Balenciaga Triple S
            shoes.

            In a big difference from the simple style of before, Gen Z really
            supports mixing patterns together. One of the best fashion trends
            for Gen Z often means wearing different colors, materials and
            designs together. It's like combining the fashion of '90s and early
            2000s to make fun outfits that really stand out. Use some stripes or
            shapes, and now you have a new style.

            Gen Z fashion styles you can buy very easily. Also, Gen Z likes

            all day. If you really like fashion, then these pants can be thought
            of as a cool yet comfy part of your wardrobe that is very important.
            In simple words, these are like the modern sweatpants you can wear

            You can make a pretty old-time look by combining different textures
            and stacking clothes. Wear a velvet jacket with a lace shirt or put
            on denim coat over flowery dress. Using prints is also important in
            old-fashioned clothing. Think about big jackets, prints that are
            tie-dyed, psychedelic designs and wide pants. Retro will be cool and
            these old-time parts will fit in well with modern feelings.
